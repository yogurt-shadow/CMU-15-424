Theorem "Asst2_6_a"

Definitions
    Real station;
    Real T;
End.

ProgramVariables
    Real vel;
    Real pos;
    Real t;
    Real acc;
End.

Problem
  vel > 0 & pos < station & T > 0 & acc = -vel^2/(2*(station - pos))
  ->
  [
      t := 0;
      {pos' = vel, vel' = acc, t' = 1 & (vel >= 0 & t <= T)}
      ](vel = 0 -> pos = station)
End.
